## Reflection

This application was quick, built over a weekend. The project's objectives included consuming PokéAPI, listing the characters, responsiveness, simplified documentation, pagination and a good interface (UI).

I used React and Javascript to facilitate the extraction of data from the Poké API, the project used the React Router that facilitated the routes, the Boostrap that helped with the visual and responsiveness.

At the end of the two days, the technologies implemented in this project are React 16.12.0, React-Router 5.1.2, React-Router-Dom 5.1.2, Boostrap, a significant amount of Vanilla JS, JSX and CSS.

I intend to continue improving the project, including tests, new resources, always seeking continuous improvement.
